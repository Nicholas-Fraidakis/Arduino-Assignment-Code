## This repository contains all the code for all the Ardiuno projects (this repo is for school)

# NOTE
Some of the code for the projects are copied from the Arduino project book so each file has it's own license! If there is no license within that file that it was copied while going step-by-step with the book to complete said project. Some projects I wrote the code from scratch so those are licensed under the zlib license!
